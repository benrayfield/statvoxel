# statvoxel
The goal of this project is to randomly select from near voxels, by a chosen nonlinear function (such as linear or squared), to display 1 gigavixel per video frame per computer, potentially in a space of many more voxels from distant/multiplayer sources but want to get it working on 1 computer first.
